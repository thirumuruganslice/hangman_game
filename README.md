Hangman is a classic word‑guessing game. You’ll get a hidden word (with a helpful category hint), and your goal is to guess it **one letter at a time** before you run out of attempts.

## ✅ How to Play

1. 📌 Check the **category hint**.
2. 🔤 Guess letters using the on‑screen keyboard or your physical keyboard.
3. ✅ Correct guesses reveal letters in the word.
4. ❌ Wrong guesses build the hangman.
5. 🏁 Guess the full word before the hangman is complete to win!
